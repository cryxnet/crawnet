# Information

The project "Crawnet" is currently in a rework phase and is no longer supported. This means that the development of the project has been temporarily halted in order to make significant improvements and changes to the existing codebase and infrastructure.

During this phase, you may experience issues with the functionality of the current version of Crawnet, as there will be no updates or bug fixes being released. However, I'm actively working on the rework and is committed to delivering an improved and more reliable version of the software as soon as possible.

The rework of Crawnet is expected to involve significant changes to the architecture and codebase of the project, which may take some time to implement and test thoroughly. Therefore, we kindly ask for your patience and understanding during this period of transition.

Rest assured that the new version of Crawnet will be released as soon as it is ready, and we will keep you updated on its progress throughout the rework phase. Thank you for your support and understanding.
